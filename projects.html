<p>Some fun stuff I’ve worked on.</p>
<h2 id="tiger-compiler">Tiger Compiler</h2>
<p>Educational compiler written in C++ for the <a
href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/">Tiger</a> language.
More context in the <a href="teaching.html#tiger-compiler">teaching</a>
section.</p>
<p>I started working on Tiger as a maintainer when I was still a student
in 2020 and worked on improving the instruction selection process by
switching from a custom code generator (<a
href="https://gitlab.lre.epita.fr/tiger/monoburg"><code>monoburg</code></a>)
to native C++ “pattern-matching” using <code>std::variant</code>s and
<code>std::visit</code>. I’d call that a mixed result: deprecating
<code>monoburg</code> was a success and meant we had one less project to
maintain, but trying to match dynamic patterns with static variants
meant that composite patterns were impossible and the matching process
is very clunky and can result in error messages thousands of lines long
(thank C++ templates)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Back then, I was expecting that
pattern-matching would eventually show up in a C++ version update<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, but I guess that’s not happening
any time soon so a student is currently working on rewriting this
without <code>std::variant</code>s.</p>
<p>Another topic I experimented with back then was adding support for
functional programming through closure conversion. The main part of the
codebase was not to be touched so I tried to leave the middle-end alone
and resolve almost everything in the front-end through a large
desugaring pass (similar to what we actually do with objects). I somehow
managed to get it to work, although the result was not pretty, and ended
up being left aside due to bikeshedding on the syntax for calls to
function pointers<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, my work mostly revolves around helping the new students
maintainer take their marks, reviewing their work, and deciding the
direction the project takes.</p>
<h2 id="keyboards">Keyboards</h2>
<p>Not technically programming, but close enough. I use split minimalist
keyboards and they’re a lot of fun, especially using <a
href="https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/combos">combos</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve had a GBoards <a
href="https://kowodo.github.io/HardwareTools/gergoPlex.html">gergoplex</a>
since 2021 and it’s great. It was cheap enough to get it delivered
directly built from Canada and I haven’t had any issue with it since I
got it. It even survived a catastrophic incident involving a spilled
coffee cup over its bare PCB, somehow. GBoards seem to have closed shop,
which is a shame because their keyboards were great.</p>
<p>My other main keyboard is a 4x6 <a
href="https://github.com/juhakaup/keyboards/tree/main/Cygnus%20v1.0">Dactyl
Cygnus</a> from Juha Kauppinen which I handbuilt in late 2024.</p>
<p><img src="img/cygnus.jpg" /></p>
<p>I wanted to have a keyboard for home which I could use both for work
and gaming, so I figured I’d need a number row and dedicated
tab/shift/control keys. After days (and nights) of 3D printing the case
and a couple days of soldering, I’m quite satisfied of the end result.
If I were to do it again I’d probably only do one half in 4x6 and the
other in 3x5 as I don’t use most of the “extra”<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
keys on the right hand side.</p>
<h2 id="this-site">This site</h2>
<p>Technically a project I guess. Built with from Markdown using
<code>pandoc</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>make</code> and some duct
tape. It’s not much but it’s mine – and way simpler than any static code
generator I could find.</p>
<p>Thanks to this <a

for giving enough motivation to get started, and <a
href="http://lukasschwab.me/blog/">these</a> <a
href="https://www.sacredheartsc.com/blog/makefile-based-blogging/">blogs</a>
for inspiration on building this using pandoc.</p>
