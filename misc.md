Aside from programming, my hobbies and centers of interest include
music (mostly rock), books & comics (mostly sci-fi), series & movies
(mostly sci-fi), tabletop RPGs (mostly DND 5 but I'm preparing a
[Mothership](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/pages/mothership-rpg) campaign),
strategy and role-playing video games, tennis...

## Music

I play a few instruments and used to write music but I'm more of a listener
these days. I try to keep track of what I've listened to [here](music.md).
