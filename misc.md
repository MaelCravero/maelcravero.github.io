Aside from programming, my hobbies and centers of interest include
music (mostly rock), books & comics (mostly sci-fi), series & movies
(mostly sci-fi), tabletop RPGs (working on an escape plan from D&D 5e),
strategy and role-playing video games and tennis.

## Music

I play a few instruments and used to write music but I'm more of a listener
these days. I try to keep track of what I've listened to [here](music.md).
