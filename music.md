title: Album reviews
---

I listen to a fair amount of music and don't always remember everything. Here's
a list of albums I've listened to and my very subjective opinion on them,
on a very unnuanced 5 stars scale.

I like to think that I have varied tastes, but listen mostly to rock-adjacent
styles. I enjoy things with influences from blues and punk, with varying amounts
of experimentation or noise. I'm currently keeping an eye on the UK
post-punk/art-rock scene in particular.

These are sorted first by artist name, then by release date (most recent first).
Cover arts are taken from [Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com).
