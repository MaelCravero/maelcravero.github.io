I'm Mael Cravero, a French software engineer at [Embecosm](https://embecosm.com)
and teacher at [EPITA](https://epita.fr). I specialize in compilers and
programming languages.

This small site is a collection of things that I felt like putting on the
internet. All opinions expressed here are my own and do not reflect those of
my employers.
