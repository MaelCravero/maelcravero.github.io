<h2 id="at-epita">At EPITA</h2>
<p>EPITA is a French “<em>grande école d’ingénieurs</em>” specialized in
software engineering and computer science based in south Paris and other
major cities around the country. It was founded in 1984 and provides a
very hands-on approach: loads of projects and practicals and multiple
internships.</p>
<p>Another specificity of EPITA is its use off “peer teaching” for
practical programming, meaning that some older students, the
<em>assistants</em>, are employed by the school to teach younger
students. There are roughly 60 assistants per year and they teach and
help with programming projects for the first 3 years of the
curriculum.</p>
<p>I studied at EPITA and was one of these assistants, graduating in
2022.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I teach there today.</p>
<h3 id="cmp-conception-de-compilateurs">CMP (<em>Conception de
Compilateurs</em>)</h3>
<p>24h class revolving around designing and implementing a compiler in
C++. Companion class for the <a href="#tiger-compiler">Tiger
Compiler</a> project.</p>
<p>In 12 weeks, we go through the entirety of the compilation pipeline,
from basic lexing/parsing to instruction selection and register
allocation. Compilers are a fascinating topic and show up even in places
where we do not necessarily expect them, as shown by the recent boom of
specialized languages for Web 3 contracts or even more recent
developments of compilation for AI and LLMs.</p>
<h3 id="tyla-typologie-des-langages">TYLA (<em>Typologie des
Langages</em>)</h3>
<p>12h class talking about programming languages: where they come from,
how to compare them, when to use which one, as well as playing with
languages most students wouldn’t otherwise encounter before graduating<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It’s easy to forget – perhaps because we have a deep emotional
connection to natural languages which we project onto them – but
programming languages are merely <em>tools</em>. Most of them have a
purpose, some of them should only be used in very specific contexts, and
some others just suck. And even if you can use a hammer to nail a screw,
maybe a screwdriver would be better<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Learning these tools,
as well as <em>learning to learn</em> them is necessary to pick up the
language your boss tells you to use or simply stay relevant as trends in
languages come and go.</p>
<p>This class is also the opportunity to give more insights on where our
everyday languages come from and how they’re essentialy all old and
flawed, as well as promoting staying up to date with recent languages,
even if they aren’t without flaws either. As with every tool, we need to
keep a critical mind and stay aware of the context we’re using them
in.</p>
<h3 id="tiger-compiler">Tiger Compiler</h3>
<p>Tiger Compiler is the 25-year-old compiler project of EPITA, and one
of the most in-depth projects teaching compilers, if not <em>the</em>
most in-depth (I might be biased).</p>
<p>It originated in late 1999 when Akim Demaille was looking for a
challenging long-term project for 3rd-year students, and has stuck
around since then. It’s still a mandatory project of the main
curriculum, and guides students through writing a compiler in C++ for
Andrew Appel’s Tiger language, following his 1998 classic book <a
href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/">Modern Compiler
Implementation</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>As the project only lasts for around two months and writing a
compiler from scratch is tough<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, students are instead
given a codebase which they are tasked with completing and improving to
support missing features. For instance, we give them a parser which
parses only basic type definitions.</p>
<p>Although students have been complaining for litteral decades about
this “fill-in-the-blanks” code, it’s proven to be very effective
for:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>having them complete the project in a reasonable time.</li>
<li>limiting the spots where they can make mistakes to where mistakes
are interesting.</li>
<li>showing them how a large project (~20 000 lines of C++) works and
should be structured, as well as how to work within it and handle legacy
code (some parts of the compiler being at this point older than
students).</li>
</ol>
<p>This last point is arguably the most important skill a software
engineer needs, and there’s no way to learn it other than browsing
through hundreds of files to build habits. This makes Tiger an
invaluable learning experience even for students uninterested in
compilers, especially since it takes place before they go on internships
where they can expect to encounter similar-ish codebases.</p>
<p>Over the years, as some students end up maintaining the project the
year after they complete it, we’ve built a very unique community of past
and present maintainers. We have a dinner each year, which is always a
great time.</p>
<p>I don’t interact with students on the project directly and instead
manage the assistants who handle the project.</p>
<p>The subject of the project can be found <a
href="https://assignments.lre.epita.fr/">here</a> and is open to
everyone. Reference source code is obviously a well-kept secret. If you
intend to do the project, please keep it private to prevent student
plagiarism. Most of the code is ours anyway.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-sorbonne">At the Sorbonne</h2>
<p>I’ve been involved with the <em>Compilation Avancée</em> class at
Sorbonne Université in M1 STL. I taught the first half of the class,
focusing on bytecode, virtual machines and garbage collection. The
project for the class consists of writing a VM for Lua5.1 bytecode,
which I find quite fun (hopefully students do too!).</p>
